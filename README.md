# Bugtracker

This is a business-centric application solving real world issues thatdevelopers issues to keep track of projects in development trough ticket system. The aim of this project is to showcases my skills in Full-Stack development. The application demonstrates proficiency in the following technologies:

- Front-end: ReactJS, a highly popular front-end JavaScript library that I learned through my coding bootcamp.
- Back-end: ASP.NET MVC, a widely used framework for web development in my region. I aim to further enhance my knowledge and expertise in this framework.
- Database: PostgreSQL, a relational database management system. The application utilizes PostgreSQL to showcase my proficiency in working with relational databases.

## Description
  The Bug Tracker System (BTS) is a web-based system designed to track and manage reported software bugs. It provides an intuitive platform for stakeholders in the software development process to submit, update, and manage bugs efficiently and securely.

  - Bug Management: Allows for submitting, editing, closing, and assigning bug reports.
  - Status Tracking: Provides real-time status tracking for individual bugs.

## User Roles
  - Administrators: Manage the system and users.
  - Developers: Responsible for fixing bugs and updating their status.
  - Testers: Report bugs and monitor their resolution.
  - Project Managers: Assign bugs to developers and oversee all bug reports.

## Technology Stack
  The BTS operates on modern web browsers and utilizes the following technologies:

  - Front-end: React.js
  - Back-end: .NET MVC
  - Database: PostgreSQL
  
## Getting Started

## Constraints and Assumptions
  This application is developed with the constraints of using React.js, .NET MVC, and PostgreSQL. It's designed to be intuitive, responsive, and secure, providing a reliable tracking system for bug management.

  Successful operation of the BTS depends on the following assumptions:

  - Proper setup and running of the PostgreSQL database.
  - Correct installation and configuration of the system.
  - User access to a modern web browser.
